#List in python
#tuples ar enothing but a type of list or also known as arrays

#Example of list
Student=["Yash","Aditya","Omkar"]
type(Student)

#how many student do list contains? Use length function
len(Student)
Student[-1]
#we can use append to add something to list, remove, and also can replace an item at specific position, also popping in python list is possible

#List can be changed but tuples cant, lists are fluid but tuples are immute
#Tuples cant be changed once written they are immune to change
#eg
s=("jan","feb","march","April","May","June","July","Aug")
type(s)

#now we cant modify this tuple like we did in case of the list.
